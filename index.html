   <h1>feeling alone, but not being alone</h1>
  <p> My character is a symbol of how some people feel right now, or after the pandemic.She’s walking around her hometown or her home city. Feeling alone because she cannot find somebody to understand her problems. She feels alone, but she not alone. She just doesn’t know how to speak about her problems. Around her everything is gray because of how she feels.  </p>
